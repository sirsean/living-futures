# Baseball Living Futures - Technical Implementation Guide

## System Architecture Overview

Baseball Living Futures is a decentralized financial platform that allows users to trade season-long derivative contracts on baseball team performance. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts** (Base Blockchain)
2. **Frontend Application** (Cloudflare Pages)
3. **Backend Services** (Cloudflare Workers)

This guide provides a high-level architecture overview and implementation roadmap for a Claude Code agent to build the complete system.

## Core Components and Design Principles

### Smart Contract Architecture

The system is built around these core smart contract modules:

1. **Virtual AMM System**
   - Sigmoid-based price discovery mechanism
   - Bounded output range (0-1000) representing win percentages
   - Position imbalance tracking without token swapping

2. **Position Management**

## Smart Contract Interaction Flow

1. **Trading Flow**
   - User connects wallet
   - Selects team and position type (long/short)
   - Enters size and margin
   - Approves token spend
   - Submits transaction
   - Position is opened with price impact calculated
   - Daily funding applies based on price vs. win% (if sufficient margin)
   - User can close, be liquidated for maintenance margin, or force-closed for funding failure

2. **Liquidity Provision Flow**
   - User selects team-specific or shared liquidity
   - Deposits collateral
   - Receives LP shares
   - Collateral is distributed to teams (if shared)
   - Fees accrue based on trading activity
   - LPs can withdraw with accrued rewards

3. **Insurance Staking Flow**
   - User deposits collateral to insurance fund
   - Receives shares of fund
   - Earns from trading fees and liquidations
   - Rate varies based on protocol activity (0% in off-season)
   - Can unstake and withdraw when needed

## Scheduled Tasks Architecture

These critical operations will run as scheduled Cloudflare Workers:

1. **Oracle Updates** (After each game)
   - Fetch game results from reliable data sources
   - Update on-chain win percentages
   - Record game outcomes for historical data

2. **Funding Payments** (Daily at 2:00 AM ET)
   - Calculate funding based on price vs. win%
   - Process payments between longs and shorts
   - Force-close positions unable to pay funding obligations
   - Update remaining positions and LP pool balances

3. **Liquidation Monitoring** (Every 5 minutes)
   - Check all positions against maintenance margin
   - Monitor position funding payment capabilities
   - Execute liquidations for underwater positions
   - Handle funding-related position closures

4. **LP Reward Distribution** (Daily)
   - Calculate fees earned by LPs
   - Update accrued rewards
   - Process distribution to shared LP

5. **Excess Profit Distribution** (Weekly)
   - Calculate system excess profit
   - Allocate to shared LP as specified
   - Update profit metrics

## Development Best Practices

1. **Smart Contract Security**

   - Infrastructure as code
   - Automated testing on PRs

## Implementation Guidance for Claude Code Agent

When implementing this system, follow these guidelines:

1. **Start with Core Contracts**
   - Begin with the Virtual AMM - this is the foundation
   - Build position management next
   - Add liquidity management
   - Implement risk systems last

2. **Modular Development**
   - Each contract should have a single responsibility
   - Use inheritance and composition carefully
   - Create interfaces for cross-contract communication
   - Favor libraries for reusable code

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each function
   - Integration tests for contract interactions
   - Scenario tests for complex flows
   - Fuzz testing for edge cases

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Component-based design
   - Custom hooks for contract interactions
   - Centralized state management
   - Responsive design patterns

5. **Worker Implementation**
   - Separate worker for each scheduled task
   - Shared utility libraries
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Monitoring and logging

By following this architecture and roadmap, the Baseball Living Futures platform can be built as a robust, secure, and user-friendly system that delivers the innovative features outlined in the whitepaper.
