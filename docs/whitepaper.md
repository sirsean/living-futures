# Baseball Living Futures: A Dynamic Derivatives Market for Team Performance

## Executive Summary

Baseball Living Futures introduces a novel financial product that combines the best aspects of futures and perpetual contracts to create a dynamic, season-long derivatives market for baseball team performance. The system enables traders to take positions on team win percentages with daily funding payments anchoring prices to reality, while providing forced settlement at season end. This whitepaper outlines the complete ecosystem design, from contract mechanics to liquidity provision and risk management systems.

**Key Innovations:**

- **Living Futures:** Season-long contracts with daily funding that reflect team performance
- **Virtual AMM:** Sigmoid-based price discovery mechanism with bounded outcomes
- **Multi-Level Liquidity:** Team-specific and shared liquidity pools with dynamic incentives
- **Risk Management:** Comprehensive insurance system with zero-base rate staking
- **System Sustainability:** Revenue-driven architecture with excess profit redistribution

This project bridges traditional sports betting and decentralized finance, creating an entirely new market for sports derivatives that benefits traders, LPs, insurance providers, and the broader ecosystem.

## Market Overview

### Problem Statement

Traditional sports betting markets suffer from:
- Limited position management (no ability to exit early)
- Poor price discovery (bookmaker-controlled)
- High fees (often 5-10% implied vig)
- Limited composability with broader financial ecosystem

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency perpetual futures have demonstrated the power of:
- Continuous trading with 24/7 markets
- Price anchoring through funding mechanisms
- Capital efficiency through leverage
- Deep liquidity through AMM models

Baseball Living Futures bridges these worlds, applying DeFi innovation to sports markets.

### Target Users

1. **Traders:**
   - Sports enthusiasts seeking more sophisticated trading tools
   - DeFi traders looking for new non-correlated markets
   - Arbitrageurs exploiting inefficiencies between traditional and crypto markets

2. **Liquidity Providers:**
   - Yield-seeking investors looking for non-correlated returns
   - Market makers experienced in sports markets
   - Diversified LPs who want balanced exposure across teams

3. **Insurance Stakers:**
   - Risk-tolerant capital providers seeking higher yields
   - Protocol supporters who want to strengthen the ecosystem
   - Institutions looking for uncorrelated insurance premium income

## Living Futures Mechanics

### Core Concept

Living Futures are season-long derivative contracts tracking team win percentages with:

1. **Underlying Asset:** Team Win Percentage × 1000 (range: 0-1000)
2. **Contract Size:** $100 per point
3. **Daily Funding:** (Contract Price - Current Win %) × 0.05%
4. **Settlement:** Cash-settled to final regular season win %
5. **Expiration:** Day after regular season ends

### Example Contract Lifecycle

```
Yankees Opening Day:
- Initial price: 500 (implied .500 win %)
- Initial contract value: $50,000

Mid-Season (Team at .620):
- Current price: 615
- Daily funding: (615 - 620) × 0.05% = -0.25%
  Longs receive, shorts pay
- Contract value: $61,500

End of Season (Final .595):
- Settlement price: 595
- Final settlement value: $59,500
```

### Position Management

Traders can:
- Open long/short positions with leverage
- Close positions at any time
- Receive/pay daily funding
- Hold until settlement
- Get automatically liquidated if margin falls below maintenance level

### Key Benefits

- **Natural Convergence:** Funding mechanism drives price toward actual win percentage
- **Position Flexibility:** Enter, exit, or adjust position size throughout season
- **Price Discovery:** Market-driven prices reflecting collective intelligence
- **Capital Efficiency:** Leverage allows efficient capital deployment

## Virtual AMM Design

### Price Discovery Mechanism

The system uses a sigmoid-based virtual AMM:

```
price = 500 + 500 * tanh(B * netPositionImbalance)

where:
- price is bounded between 0 and 1000
- B is a sensitivity parameter (controls curve steepness)
- netPositionImbalance = (longPositions - shortPositions) / totalLiquidity
```

This creates:
- **Natural Bounds:** Prices constrained to win percentage range (0-1000)
- **Resistance at Extremes:** Increasingly difficult to push price near boundaries
- **Increasing Impact:** Deeper price impact with larger imbalances

### Virtual Liquidity

Unlike traditional AMMs with actual token swapping:
- **Virtual Balances:** Track position imbalances without physical tokens
- **LP Counter-Position:** LPs effectively take opposite side of net trader position
- **No Impermanent Loss:** Bounded range with known settlement eliminates IL risk

### Oracle Integration

- Live game results update win percentages via a robust oracle system
- Oracle publishes daily win % for each team
- Funding calculations use oracle-verified data
- End-of-season settlement uses final oracle-verified win %

## Liquidity Provision System

### Team-Specific Liquidity

LPs can provide liquidity to specific teams:

- **Deposit:** Collateral allocated to specific team's virtual AMM
- **Returns:** Trading fees + funding payments + liquidation income
- **APY Source:** Purely from market activity, no emissions
- **Team-Specific Fee Multipliers:** Dynamic based on liquidity needs

### Shared Liquidity Distribution

Meta-liquidity pool for ecosystem-wide exposure:

- **Equal Distribution:** Deposits spread evenly across all teams initially
- **Dynamic Rebalancing:** Periodically reallocates to underserved teams
- **Exposure:** Single position provides diversified market exposure
- **Simplified UX:** One deposit instead of 30 separate positions

### Excess Profit Utilization

- 50% of excess profit adds to shared LP (owned by protocol)
- 50% distributed to existing shared LP providers
- Creates perfect alignment between protocol success and LP returns

### Liquidity Incentives

- **Volume-Based:** Higher APY for teams with more trading activity
- **Need-Based:** Increased multipliers for teams with liquidity shortages
- **Balanced Portfolio Bonus:** Rewards for supporting multiple teams
- **Seasonal Dynamics:** APY during season, 0% during off-season

## Risk Management & Insurance

### Insurance Fund

- **Purpose:** Protect system from bad debt from liquidations
- **Structure:** Per-team allocations within global fund
- **Funding Sources:** Trading fees, liquidation penalties
- **Utilization:** Covers liquidation shortfalls if trader margin insufficient

### Insurance Staking

- **Mechanism:** Users stake collateral to grow insurance fund
- **Returns:** Share of trading fees + liquidation penalties
- **APY Source:** Pure protocol revenue, 0% base rate
- **Seasonal Dynamics:** 0% APY during off-season

### Liquidation Process

- **Threshold:** Maintenance margin requirement based on position size
- **Process:** Positions liquidated when equity below maintenance
- **Incentives:** Liquidators receive fee for successful liquidations
- **Shortfall Handling:** Insurance fund covers underwater positions

### Circuit Breakers

- **Price Limits:** Maximum move per day on each contract
- **Emergency Mode:** Ability to pause new positions in extreme conditions
- **Deleveraging:** Automatic position reduction if system risks exceed thresholds

## Oracle Infrastructure

- **Primary:** Official MLB game results
- **Backup:** Multiple data providers for redundancy
- **Validation:** Consensus mechanism across data sources

### Update Mechanism

- **Game Results:** Real-time updates after each game
- **Win Percentage:** Calculated after each game conclusion
- **Settlement Data:** Final regular season records

### Node Operations

- **Decentralized Network:** Multiple oracle nodes
- **Consensus Requirement:** 2/3 majority for updates
- **Dispute Resolution:** Governance mechanism for edge cases

## Tokenomics & Governance

- **Distribution:**
  - 60% to LPs
  - 20% to Insurance Fund
  - 10% to Protocol Treasury
