      <h1>Baseball Living Futures: A Dynamic Derivatives Market for Team Performance</h1>
      
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      
      <p>
        Baseball Living Futures introduces a novel financial product that combines the best aspects of futures and perpetual contracts to create a dynamic, season-long derivatives market for baseball team performance. The system enables traders to take positions on team win percentages with daily funding payments anchoring prices to reality, while providing forced settlement at season end. This whitepaper outlines the complete ecosystem design, from contract mechanics to liquidity provision and risk management systems.

      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      
      <p>Traditional sports betting markets suffer from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Limited position management (no ability to exit early)</li>
        <li>Poor price discovery (bookmaker-controlled)</li>
        <li>High fees (often 5-10% implied vig)</li>
        <li>Limited composability with broader financial ecosystem</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Meanwhile, cryptocurrency perpetual futures have demonstrated the power of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuous trading with 24/7 markets</li>
        <li>Price anchoring through funding mechanisms</li>
        <li>Capital efficiency through leverage</li>
        <li>Deep liquidity through AMM models</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Baseball Living Futures bridges these worlds, applying DeFi innovation to sports markets.</p>

      <h2 id="living-futures-mechanics">Living Futures Mechanics</h2>
      
      <h3>Core Concept</h3>
      
      <p>Living Futures are season-long derivative contracts tracking team win percentages with:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Underlying Asset:</strong> Team Win Percentage × 1000 (range: 0-1000)</li>
        <li><strong>Contract Size:</strong> $100 per point</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Funding:</strong> (Contract Price - Current Win %) × 0.05%</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> Cash-settled to final regular season win %</li>
        <li><strong>Expiration:</strong> Day after regular season ends</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Example Contract Lifecycle</h3>
      
      <pre><code>{`Yankees Opening Day:
- Initial price: 500 (implied .500 win %)
- Initial contract value: $50,000

Mid-Season (Team at .620):
- Current price: 615
- Daily funding: (615 - 620) × 0.05% = -0.25%
  Longs receive, shorts pay
- Contract value: $61,500

End of Season (Final .595):
- Settlement price: 595
- Final settlement value: $59,500`}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Position Management</h3>
      
      <p>Traders can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open long/short positions with leverage</li>
        <li>Close positions at any time</li>
        <li>Receive/pay daily funding</li>
        <li>Hold until settlement</li>
        <li>Get automatically liquidated if margin falls below maintenance level</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Convergence:</strong> Funding mechanism drives price toward actual win percentage</li>
        <li><strong>Position Flexibility:</strong> Enter, exit, or adjust position size throughout season</li>
        <li><strong>Price Discovery:</strong> Market-driven prices reflecting collective intelligence</li>
        <li><strong>Capital Efficiency:</strong> Leverage allows efficient capital deployment</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 id="virtual-amm-design">Virtual AMM Design</h2>
      
      <h3>Price Discovery Mechanism</h3>
      
      <p>The system uses a sigmoid-based virtual AMM:</p>
      
      <pre><code>{`price = 500 + 500 * tanh(B * netPositionImbalance)

where:
- price is bounded between 0 and 1000
- B is a sensitivity parameter (controls curve steepness)
- netPositionImbalance = (longPositions - shortPositions) / totalLiquidity`}</code></pre>
      
      <p>This creates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Bounds:</strong> Prices constrained to win percentage range (0-1000)</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance at Extremes:</strong> Increasingly difficult to push price near boundaries</li>
        <li><strong>Increasing Impact:</strong> Deeper price impact with larger imbalances</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Virtual Liquidity</h3>
      
      <p>Unlike traditional AMMs with actual token swapping:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual Balances:</strong> Track position imbalances without physical tokens</li>
        <li><strong>LP Counter-Position:</strong> LPs effectively take opposite side of net trader position</li>
        <li><strong>No Impermanent Loss:</strong> Bounded range with known settlement eliminates IL risk</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Oracle Integration</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Live game results update win percentages via a robust oracle system</li>
        <li>Oracle publishes daily win % for each team</li>
        <li>Funding calculations use oracle-verified data</li>
        <li>End-of-season settlement uses final oracle-verified win %</li>
      </ul>
